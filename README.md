# 🛍️ Smart Shopping List

![Project Banner](./banner.png)

This project is a web application built with **React** that allows users to add, view, and organize products in a shopping list.  
Each item is automatically categorized (Fruits, Dairy, Meat, Cleaning, Beverages, and more).  
All data is synced with an **external API** using `fetch`, ensuring persistence between sessions.
